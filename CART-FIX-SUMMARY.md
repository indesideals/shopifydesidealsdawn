# Cart Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your Shopify store was experiencing "sold out" errors when trying to add products to cart, even though products were in stock. This was caused by a **conflicting cart system**:

### Root Cause
1. **LocalStorage Cart System**: The theme was using a custom localStorage-based cart system
2. **Shopify Native Cart System**: There were also traditional Shopify forms with `action="/cart/add"`
3. **Form Prevention**: The theme was preventing ALL form submissions to `/cart/add`
4. **Cart Mismatch**: Items were added to localStorage but not to Shopify's actual cart

### The Issue Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" â†’ Item goes to localStorage
2. User tries to checkout â†’ Shopify's cart is empty
3. Shopify shows "sold out" error because the product isn't in the actual cart

## Fixes Applied

- **Removed**: localStorage cart system

### 3. Updated Collection Template (`templates/collection.liquid`)
